This admin dashboard is a project that i've created to help me get more comfortable using css grid for website layouts. It is the final project in the intermediate html and css section of The Odin Projects full-stack Javascript pathway. I'm planning on digging a little bit deeper into html's semantic elements to help me structure this layout in hopes that I can improve my ability to write descriptive, easy to read markup.
