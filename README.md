<i>This admin dashboard is the final project in the intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Projects full-stack Javascript pathway. It is a static webpage that i've created with the goal of improving my ability to recreate and personalize complex layouts from an existing design reference file.</i>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

This project gave me the opportunity to focus specifically on improving my CSS grid and flexbox layout skills. I learned how to recreate a complex layout from scratch using the box model, how to modify and position SVG elements, and how to work with a variety of relative units to facilitate responsive design.

<h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>

This project was not intended to be fully responsive, however to get more practice working with small resolutions I would have ultimately been better off using a mobile-first approach and creating a version of the dashboard that looks great in a more condensed format. I noticed that it is far more difficult to make a design mobile-friendly when it is first designed in a desktop resolution, so for my next projects I am going to design for a small screen and build outwards.
